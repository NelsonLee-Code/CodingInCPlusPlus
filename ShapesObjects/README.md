<h1>
  Project: Shape with Dynamically Allocated Objects and Arrays
</h1>

This Shape with Dynamically Allocated Objects and Arrays Project, hereafter referred to as the Dynamic Shape Project, uses C++ I/O streams (including error handling), constructors, accessors, mutators, and the dynamic allocation and de-allocation of arrays and objects. 

- Inside the Parser file, we use stringstream to check for errors from the user input (errors are checked word for word, from left to right, in priority order as seen in Figure 1), cin functions such as peek, clear, fail flags, and EOF flags, and then dynamically allocates objects and arrays to create Shapes
- Inside the Shape class, we hold the properties of a shape, such as name, type, location, and more
