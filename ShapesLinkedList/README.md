<h1>
  Project: Shape with Linked Lists
</h1>

This Shape with Linked Lists Project uses, creates, and maniuplates linked lists with constructors and destructors done with dynamic allocation and de-allocation without any memory leaks, which is checked with Valgrind. The structure of the linked list can be seen in Figure 1.

- Inside the Parser file, we collect user input (we assume input contains little to no errors), dynamically allocates and de-allocates linked lists, and more
- Inside the GroupList class, we create a linked list of GroupNodes containing head and numerous GroupNodes
- Inside the ShapeList class, we create a linked list of ShapeNodes containing head and numerous ShapeNodes
- Inside the GroupNode class, we create a node in a linked list of GroupNodes with name, myShapeList, and next
- Inside the ShapeNode class, we create a node in a linked list of ShapeNodes with the shape myShape (points to a Shape object) and next
- Inside the Shape class, we hold the properties of a shape, such as its name, type, location, and size
