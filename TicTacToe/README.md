<h1>
  Project: TicTacToe Game
</h1>

This TicTaeToe project uses classes, objects, and methods to build a basic TieTacToe game that allows users to play the game with the program implementing the logic and determining a winner.

- Inside the GameState class, we store the current gamestate of the TicTacToe in an object that is created, initialized, and then destroyed by the controller
- Inside the playMove function, the program will update the board, turn, validMove, and determine if the game is over, who wins, and which wincode was used to win
- Inside the GameController file, we create and initialize the game board, prompt the user for input with error-checking, and then call the playMove function and print the GameState class

When a player wins, we also output a WinCode based on how the game was won, as seen in Figure 2.
